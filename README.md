# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Plastic-Waste-Using-K-Means-Clustering
Mismanaged Plastic Waste is very serious problem for not only human but also any other animals and whole ecosystem. So I tried
analysis of data which includes total mismanaged plastic waste by countries and mismanaged plastic waster per capita in 2010 and
2019. Mismanaged plastic waste includes materials burned in open pits, dumped into seas or open waters, or disposed of in unsanitary
landfills and dumpsites. Without proper waste management systems, this growth in consumption leads to a significant increase in
mismanaged waste. This leads to pollution of the ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, and the ocean. This helps in understanding that
mismanaged plastic waste involves various unsustainable practices that contribute to environmental pollution.

- Conducted K-Means clustering on global plastic waste data, identifying major contributors such as India and China, and forming three distinct clusters based on contributions. Analyzed large datasets to reveal significant patterns and need for targeted interventions.
- Demonstrated skills in data preprocessing, clustering analysis, and interpretation with Plotly for visualizing maps and Seaborn Heat map correlations. Addressed K-Means limitations, ensuring robust data handling for actionable insights to inform environmental strategies
